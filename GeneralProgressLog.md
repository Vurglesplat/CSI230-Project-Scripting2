# Progress Log
### General Overview
In general defiance of the much more reccomended gradual improvement of files over steady but gradual work, I prefer to work on my projects in massive chunks of time.
This is because I hate having to try and remember where I was and onboard myself with what I was doing much more than simply working on something for a larger chunk
of time. 
As a result of this There likely won't be more than 1 or 2 days spent on this project, so the general time of changes will be listed as well as the 
date to be more helpful. 

With that out of the way, on with the show.

### 12:50 20 Oct 2020
Set up some additional emails to help with the rest as well as setting up this initial github, in a pretty good mood today so I'm confident I can plough through this,
hopefully won't be regretting these words later. Class soon so I'll be picking this up and really getting started later today, just used githubs own docs for reference 
to set these up, specifically [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax())

- [x] A github link to your script
- [x] A github link to your project notes in markdown format
  - [x] What internet sources did you use for each element of the pseudo code?
  - [x] Notes should have a chronology of your progress
- [ ] A googledoc link to your demonstration video where you demonstrate.
  - [ ] show the absence of accounts before the run
  - [ ] An e-mail script run using at least 3 student e-mails, including your instructor's email address .  Add this last so as not to irritate your instructor with spam during testing.
show a screenshot of one of the received e-mails (an account under your control)
  - [ ] test your login via ssh using the new credentials
  - [ ] you should be directed to change your password
  - [ ] do a repeat run using a single account already created
  - [ ] this should result in a simple password change
  - [ ] repeat the login process for that account.
